Write a one-word response, "yes" or "no", without anything else to the following question. No capitalize and no period or any other marks (respond "yes" insead of "Yes."). 

Note that, the question might be very tricky... They might ask you an ambiguous concept, or requires you to spot a very small area on the image. So look closely on details and think carefully what the object the word is referring to, exactly. 

The question is: {original_prompt}
